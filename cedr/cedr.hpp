// One can solve a subset of these.
//   If !conserve, then the CDR does not alter the tracer mass, but it does not
// correct for any failure in mass conservation in the field given to it.
//   If consistent but !shapepreserve, the the CDR solves the dynamic range
// preservation problem rather than the local bound preservation problem.
